## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analyis was to create an interactive website that was capable of taking a large swath of UFO-sighting data and filter the information into a digestable visual aide based on multi-level filter system. The designed table is filterable based on date, city, state, country, and entity shape.

### Website:

## Results:

Website users were able to filter data by inputting desired criteria into one of the previously listed fields. Once inputed, the javascript code filtered through the raw data.js and displayed any relevant results.

### Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

One drawback of this website is it is extremely case sensitive. If someone inputs the word "washington" instead of "wa" into the filter, no results will display. This is an innacuurate and all around clunky feature.  I would recommend adding more key terms to each filter class to broaden search engine capabilities. Another addition that would be benficial would be to increase the amount of raw data accessed. The data provided was a good starting point, but it only goes for 13 days in the year 2010. I would like to expand data.js to have signiicantly more sightings included and perhaps a "filter by date" option to sort out most recent sightings.
